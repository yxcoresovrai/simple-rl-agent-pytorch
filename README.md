# 🧠 Simple Deep Q-Network (DQN) in PyTorch

This repository contains a **minimal implementation** of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning agent, built using **PyTorch** and trained on the classic **CartPole-v1** environment from OpenAI Gym.

The model learns to balance a pole on a moving cart by using **Q-learning**, experience replay, and a basic feedforward neural network.
